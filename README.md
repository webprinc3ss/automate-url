# URL GENERATOR

The purpose of this script is to transform a URL into a type of string that our Drupal Add API Module can use.

## How it's done
1. ES5 Function using an event listener connected to a function to convert one URL string into something else based on user prompt input.  The result is then written on to the page. (DONE - 7/19/21)

2.  replace() in conjunction with regex statements are used to reformat and add an the api number to each string. (DONE - 7/19/21)

3.  Prompts will be replaced with form interface.

4.  Function will be converted to ES6 (as a comparison exercise).

5. Clean-up. Remove comments and make code prettier.
